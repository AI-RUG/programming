        <h2>Before you start</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The following exercises are of increasing difficulty and meant to be done in the programming language Python. 
            The goal of this assignment is to get a taste of what it is like to solve problems using programming. 
            You will get a small introduction during the practical itself. 
            If you want more examples or more explanations, check out: <a href="https://youtu.be/5BHWx6Cx07k?t=44">this video</a>. 
            It is quite a long video, so make sure to read the assignments first and stop watching when you know what you need to know. 
            Another good source of information is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">this website</a>. 
        </p>

        <h3>How to run your code</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to run your Python code for these exercises is on <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">this website</a>. 
            On the left you will be able to write your script. 
            The right side shows your terminal. 
            You can run your script by clicking the "run" button. 
            You are also free to figure out how to install and run Python on your own computer, but we do not recommend this for the practical due to the short amount of time available for doing the exercises. 
        </p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>You can work on the exercises by yourself. You are always welcome to ask questions, but as every programmer can tell you: Google is your best friend! 
        It has the answers to every programming-related question you can think of. Just make sure to specify that you are looking for a solution for Python.
        When you think you solved the problem, you can check the answer yourself by clicking the button below the exercise.
        If the solution we provided is different from yours and you don't know why, feel free to ask why! 
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Exercises</h2>

        <div class="content">
        <h3>Exercise 1: Hello World</h3>
        <p>If you have dabbled in programming before, you may be familiar with the “Hello World” program.
            This is a small program that prints “Hello world” to the terminal. If you have programmed and/or
            written a hello world program before, it is okay to skip this exercise.</p>
        
        <p class="ex">Try to write a program in Python that prints the text “Hello
            World'' to the terminal.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 2: Hello [name]</h3>
        <p>There's nothing quite like being greeted.</p>
        <p class="ex">Write a program that asks for your name, and then greets you using
            your name.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 3: Hello Alice and Bob</h3>
        <p>Today, I have decided that I only want to greet Alice and Bob.</p>
        <p class="ex">Write a program that only greets users called Alice or
            Bob.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 4: Very odd</h3>
        <p>At this point, I hope you know how to tell whether a number is even or
            odd. However, sometimes it's just easier to be able to ask someone (or in this case, something) else.</p>
        <p class="ex">Write a program that takes a number as input, and prints whether
            that number is even or odd.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 5: Give me sum</h3>
        <p>Sometimes it is useful to calculate the sum of the numbers 1 to n. For n = 3 this sum would be
            1 + 2 + 3 = 6. For small numbers it is not very difficult to calculate this yourself, but for large
            numbers it can take some time.</p>
        <p class="ex">Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the
            sum of the numbers 1 to n.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 6: Multiples of 3 and 5 only</h3>
        <p>The previous program can be altered in many ways. You may only like multiples of certain numbers. 
            I only like multiples of 3 and 5, such as
            3, 5, 6, 9, 10, etc.</p>
        <p class="ex">Modify the previous program such that it only sums the multiples of three or five in the range of i to n.</p>
        
        <h3>Exercise 7: Product or sum?</h3>
        <p>We would like to continue building on the previous program. Sometimes,
            you may need the factorial instead of the sum. The factorial of
            a number n is the product of numbers 1 until n.</p>
        <p class="ex">Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between
            computing the sum and computing the product of 1,...,n.</p>
            
        
        <h3>Exercise 8: Guessing game</h3>
        <p> This next exercise shows you a more practical application of things you have used so far. It's a game! Because this game has some room for creative freedom, we will leave it up to you whether the user can specify a range or whether there is a standard range. 
            We also have not talked about libraries yet. You will learn about that if you choose to study AI. For now, follow the following instructions if you want to generate a random number in a certain range in Python:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Put <code>import random</code> all the way at the top of your code. It needs to be the very first thing in your file. </li>
            <li>If you want to generate a number between x and y, type random.randint(x, y). This range is <b>inclusive</b>, which means that both x and y could be the random number.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ex">Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number.
            After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was
            too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be
            printed.</p>
        
        <h3>Exercise 9: Leap years ahead</h3>
        <p>Some things are more complex than they look. The problem below is one of those things. While
            solving it, do not just increment the first leap year you find by 4. Please make sure to check
            whether something is a leap year by using the rules for when something is a leap year. If you do
            not know those by heart (it’s more complex than it seems), Google it!</p>
        <p class="ex">Write a program that takes a year as an input and that prints both
            whether that year is a leap year, and the next 20 leap years.</p>
        
        <h3>Exercise 10: Raise a glass!</h3>
        <p>Surprise! To celebrate the end of this practical, we’d like you to try solving a programming exercise
            from the first week of the AI first-year course ‘Imperative Programming’. The phrasing is exactly
            the same as in the original assignment. Good luck!</p>
        <p>John wants to celebrate that he has passed the course ’Imperative Programming’ with his friends.
            The plan is to serve everyone (including himself) one glass with 150ml of champagne. John found
            a website where you can order champagne per Magnum bottle (containing 1.5 litres)</p>
        
        <p class="ex">Write a program that reads from the input the number of invited
            friends (a positive integer) and outputs the number of bottles that John
            needs to order.</p>
